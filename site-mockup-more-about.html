	 <p>This website is a portfolio and site to keep track of my platforms and business. Through this site, I keep track of posted artwork,
		 commission inquiries, character concepts, and general online activity. this site will also work as an archive in the future for my progress as an artist.</p>
		<center><h2>ABOUT ME</h2></center>
		<p>Hello! I go by Orchid, And this is my portfolio site. I am an autistic person with a huge passion for art and character creation. throughout
			 the site there will be information and details on my projects and passions.  </p>
		<center><h2>ABOUT MY WORK</h2></center>
		<p>In all my artwork you will see a heavy influence of large eyes and soft or muted colors. The majority of my work is inspired by dolls,
			 puppets, vintage illustrations and a love of macabre in general.
			 I am also very inspired by all things deemed unsettling and cute. I strive to find a solid balance between both traits and use it in my art accordingly. </p>
